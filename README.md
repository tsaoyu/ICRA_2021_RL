# ICRA_2021_RL
Paper list on ICRA reinforcement learning


You can also use ICRA area summary notebook to generate a list like this for any area.
The notebook should be self explanatory and what you need to change is the `rlpapers.txt`.

Simply copy all `<td>` HTML tag of the papers you interested, the notebook will do the rest for you.
This project relies on the following 

```
pandas
beautifulsoup
requests
```
it is more likely your dependency is missing than the code is wrong.

Thanks for using and happy hacking.
